Techniques 

Part 1: Classes and Object-Oriented Programming
Class Creation: Designed a Task class to encapsulate task-related data and behaviors.
Properties and Methods: Included essential properties (title, description, completed) and methods (markCompleted(), updateDescription()).
Static Methods: Implemented a static method totalTasks() to keep track of the total number of tasks created.
Default Values: Set default values for properties, such as completed defaulting to false.

Part 2: Inheritance and Polymorphism
Inheritance: Created a PriorityTask class that extends the Task class, adding a priority property.
Method Overriding: Overrode the markCompleted() method to provide a custom message when a priority task is completed.
Polymorphism: Utilized polymorphism to treat PriorityTask instances as Task instances when appropriate.

Part 3: Type Annotations and Interfaces
Interfaces: Defined a TeamMember interface to specify the structure of team member objects.
Type Annotations: Applied type annotations throughout the code to ensure type safety and clarity.
Function Implementation: Developed an assignTask() function to assign tasks to team members, adhering to the TeamMember interface.

Part 4: Generics
Generic Classes: Implemented a Queue<T> class using generics to handle items of any data type.
Type Parameters: Leveraged type parameters to make the queue flexible for different types like Task or TeamMember.
Encapsulation: Ensured that the internal state of the queue is managed properly, exposing only necessary methods.

Part 5: Functions and Higher-Order Functions
Higher-Order Functions: Created createTaskUpdater(), a function that accepts another function as an argument to update tasks.
Function Composition: Used higher-order functions to build specialized task updater functions like markAsUrgent().
Type Guards: Implemented type checks to ensure that tasks are of the correct type before applying updates.

Part 6: Asynchronous Programming
Async/Await: Wrote the fetchTasks() function using async/await to simulate asynchronous data fetching.
Promises: Utilized Promises to handle asynchronous operations, simulating both success and failure scenarios.
Error Handling: Employed try/catch blocks to manage errors during asynchronous operations effectively.

Part 7: Array Methods
Map Method: Used map() to transform an array of tasks into an array of task titles.
Filter Method: Applied filter() to retrieve tasks that are incomplete.
Reduce Method: Implemented reduce() to count the total number of completed tasks.

Part 8: Error Handling
JSON Parsing: Attempted to parse JSON data in the parseTaskData() function, handling potential errors.
Try/Catch Blocks: Wrapped parsing logic in try/catch to gracefully handle exceptions.
Custom Error Messages: Provided informative error messages to help diagnose parsing issues.

Part 9: Modules and Imports/Exports
Modularization: Organized code into separate files (taskUtils.ts, index.ts) for better structure and maintainability.
Import/Export Syntax: Used ES6 module syntax for importing and exporting functionalities across modules.
Reusability: Created utility functions like calculateTotalCompletedTasks() for use in various parts of the application.

Problem-Solving Approach

Requirement Analysis: Thoroughly analyzed each part of the task to fully understand the requirements and objectives.

Incremental Development: Divided the project into smaller, manageable sections corresponding to each feature.

Emphasizing Reusability and Modularity: Wrote generic classes and functions, and organized code into modules to promote reusability and ease of maintenance.

Robust Error Handling: Anticipated potential errors and implemented comprehensive error handling mechanisms, especially in asynchronous operations and data parsing.
